                My husband Ron and I have been married for 35 years and we had the joy of raising two wonderful active boys, Joey and Jesse.   With them being involved in everything you can possibly imagine through their childhood, including BMX racing, every sport, music, and motorcycles, we survived through the many “gray haired” years!

                    2011 has been a great year with both of our boys getting married!  I also now have one adorable grandson named Corbin Levi, and he is the apple of my eye! We have been waiting a long time to become grandparents, and now have been blessed with a gorgeous healthy little boy, hopefully with more to come!!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I worked in the dentistry field for 20 years right out of college.  This is where I gained a great deal of experience in listening to and nurturing people who really didn’t care to be there!  From dentistry I decided to try the building industry and became a general contractor with the encouragement of my husband.  I absolutely loved building homes, and when a friend of mine who is a very successful Realtor, highly encouraged me to sell Real Estate, it took me awhile to leave the building industry.  I am proud to say that I have brought the same level of pride of workmanship and attention to detail with me into my Real Estate Career.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No matter what I decide to try, I will always give 150%.   I also love working in the Real Estate field even though it is much more demanding on my so called “free time”.  When I try to take some time to myself, I really enjoy riding my mule, Samule, and my Quarter Horse, Bogie.   I used to show “Sammy” extensively, but unfortunately I have not had the time to put the work it takes to show him and to compete against the horses.  I am a real animal lover, so when I’m not able to spend as much time as I would like with my big boys at the barn, I enjoy our little Yorkies, Buckwheat and Darla.

                <p>At this crucial time, in a changing market, people need a hard working, honest, and knowledgeable realtor to help them through this challenging market.  At a time when numerous realtors are deciding to try other careers, is the time when Sheri Tilton just digs in her heels and works even harder to fulfill her client's needs and expectations.  She is firmly committed to her career in Real Estate, and will continue to be there to listen carefully to you, and will definitely “Go the Extra Mile” to serve your Real Estate needs.  Her professionalism and expertise are the difference you cannot afford to be without.</p>

                <p>Sheri’s background work history and extreme work ethics have been a huge advantage and a real benefit for her clients.  With her 6 years of being a builder, along with working with her husband in excavation, her extensive background in both building and excavation has contributed towards her knowledge and expertise in her real estate career.  She has physically been down in the ditches installing numerous drain fields, septic systems, and sewer lines.  She can point out the difference of an older 3 tab roof verses an updated architectural roof, explain the difference between an active and passive radon system, and can try to determine on how difficult it may be to add that 3rd bathroom in the basement depending on the location of the plumbing and where the elevation of the septic or sewer line is entering the home if it is even visible.  She  will normally  check out the electrical panel boxes to see if they are a Federal Pacific brand, for they have been recalled, along with the era of when the LP siding had the class action suit.</p>

                <p>The excavation background has been a huge benefit for her clients that are looking at raw land with the dream of building their own home.  She has a general knowledge of the different types of soil, with the potential types of septic systems they could be up against.  She’s always looking for the perfect slope to provide the desirable daylight walk-out basement, and points out to her clients on where the sun rises and sets, so they can determine on how they may want to design their home.  Evening shade is perfect for those summer BBQ’s!</p>

                <p>With Sheri also having a long lasting love for horses since she was a small girl, she has a tremendous amount of knowledge in the equestrian properties.  She owns a beautiful black quarter horse that she is very proud to say has been used in a therapeutic riding program for handicapped children and adults.  She also has a gorgeous Appaloosa Mule in which she has shown and won against the horses.  The many years of horse ownership is also a large benefit for her equestrian clients.</p>

                <p>If you are currently in the market for an existing home, looking to build a new home, or are interested in an equestrian property, you need to rely on Sheri Tilton’s expertise.  She will definitely “Go the Extra Mile” for you.  That is why Sheri Tilton is blessed with at least 90% of her business coming from referrals, and she will always strive to fulfill her client’s needs and expectations.</p>

                <p>I’m a wife, mother, and grandmother so I know the importance of family when searching for just the right home for you.  I know how important the schools are, and the location to fit your needs.  I hope this page has enabled you to learn a little more about me, and hopefully you will give me the opportunity of getting to know you!  My pledge to you is to go that “Extra Mile” to make your Real Estate process run as smooth and stress free as possible.</p>
