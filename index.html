                Hi there!  I thought this may be a page where you can learn a little more about me and who I am.

                My husband Ron and I have been married for 35 years and we had the joy of raising two wonderful active boys, Joey and Jesse.   With them being involved in everything you can possibly imagine through their childhood, including BMX racing, every sport, music, and motorcycles, we survived through the many “gray haired” years!

                    2011 has been a great year with both of our boys getting married!  I also now have one adorable grandson named Corbin Levi, and he is the apple of my eye! We have been waiting a long time to become grandparents, and now have been blessed with a gorgeous healthy little boy, hopefully with more to come!!

                    I worked in the dentistry field for 20 years right out of college.  This is where I gained a great deal of experience in listening to and nurturing people who really didn’t care to be there!  From dentistry I decided to try the building industry and became a general contractor with the encouragement of my husband.  I absolutely loved building homes, and when a friend of mine who is a very successful Realtor, highly encouraged me to sell Real Estate, it took me awhile to leave the building industry.  I am proud to say that I have brought the same level of pride of workmanship and attention to detail with me into my Real Estate Career.

                    No matter what I decide to try, I will always give 150%.   I also love working in the Real Estate field even though it is much more demanding on my so called “free time”.  When I try to take some time to myself, I really enjoy riding my mule, Samule, and my Quarter Horse, Bogie.   I used to show “Sammy” extensively, but unfortunately I have not had the time to put the work it takes to show him and to compete against the horses.  I am a real animal lover, so when I’m not able to spend as much time as I would like with my big boys at the barn, I enjoy our little Yorkies, Buckwheat and Darla.
